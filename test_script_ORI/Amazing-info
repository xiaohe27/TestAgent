When using ajc to weave the source java files and aj files, even if the orginal file does not compile due to execeeding the 64KB method size constraint, 

ajc can still generate the weaved code successfully which is runnable.

Maybe AJC compiler does some optimization on the source code level to make it more space efficient.

There are not any problems found in terms of code size if we provide the source code, instead of byte code to the AJC compiler.
